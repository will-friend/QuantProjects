# REPOSITORY OVERVIEW
This repository holds code from different quantitative trading strategies implemented. The files will be either Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) or Python code files (.py). These projects serve as my way of practicing the different areas I have learned about in systematic trading thus far. If there are areas where my code can be improved or if you want to just talk about some of them, please feel free to contact me :)
